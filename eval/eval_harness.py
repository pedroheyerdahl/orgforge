eval_harness.py
===============
OrgForge Eval Dataset Generator — v2

Produces three novel eval tracks that require the deterministic state machine
to exist. No retrieval questions. Those are covered by other benchmarks.

Run after flow.py and post_sim_artifacts.py complete:
    python eval_harness.py

Produces in export/eval/:
    actor_visibility.json      — per-actor artifact visibility cones, time-indexed
    causal_link_index.json     — explicit causal links derived from sim flags
    absence_catalog.json       — expected-but-absent artifact pairs
    eval_questions.json        — PERSPECTIVE + COUNTERFACTUAL + SILENCE questions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TRACK 1 — PERSPECTIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Questions scoped to what a specific actor could have known at a specific moment,
given their actual subsystem access and information horizon.

Ground truth is derived from the actor's visibility cone: the set of artifact IDs
reachable by that actor at or before as_of_time, filtered by subsystem access.

Cross-subsystem questions (e.g. engineer sees Slack + Zoom but not Salesforce)
are flagged difficulty="hard". Single-subsystem questions are "medium".

Example:
  "Based only on what Morgan had access to as of Day 9, should she have known
   that Acme Corp was at churn risk?"
  ground_truth: { "answer": False, "reason": "sf_deals_risk_flagged not in Morgan's visibility cone" }

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TRACK 2 — COUNTERFACTUAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Questions of the form "if X had been different, would Y have occurred?"
Only generated where the sim encodes an explicit causal link:
  - involves_gap / knowledge_gap_detected  → incident causation
  - recurrence_of                          → repeat incident prevention
  - spawned_doc                            → design discussion → documentation
  - email_dropped                          → unactioned communication
  - sf_ownership_lapsed                    → CRM ownership gap
  - zd_escalation_source                   → support ticket → incident

Ground truth is always derivable from the explicit link without inference.

Example:
  "If Jordan had documented auth-service before departing, would incident IT-108
   have been diagnosed faster?"
  ground_truth: { "outcome_changed": True, "mechanism": "knowledge_gap_detected",
                  "gap_domain": "auth-service", "causal_event": "evt_..." }

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TRACK 3 — SILENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Questions about things that did NOT happen. The state machine is the arbiter:
if no event fired, absence is ground truth regardless of whether absence was
intentional.

Each SILENCE question includes an expected_search_space — the artifact IDs the
agent MUST check before concluding absence. A correct "no" reached without
searching the right places scores 0 on trajectory even if the boolean is right.

Example:
  "Was a postmortem written for the Zendesk escalation on Day 6?"
  ground_truth: False
  expected_search_space: ["confluence/postmortems/", "jira/IT-*", "slack/incidents"]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Design principles
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Ground truth is always derived from SimEvent log. LLMs only write prose.
- Question prose generation includes a structured validation loop.
- Actor visibility cones are first-class data structures, not a scoring afterthought.
- Subsystem access is explicitly modeled per actor per day.
- The absence catalog is built by pattern-matching expected event pairs, not heuristics.
