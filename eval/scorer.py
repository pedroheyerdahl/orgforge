=========
Per-question-type scoring for the OrgForge eval dataset.

Design principles
-----------------
  1. Scores are always in [0.0, 1.0] — comparable across question types.
  2. Partial credit is supported everywhere via evidence_chain overlap.
  3. Each scorer returns a ScorerResult so callers can aggregate, filter,
     or report by type independently.
  4. No LLM involvement — scoring is deterministic and reproducible.

Question types handled
----------------------
  RETRIEVAL     Exact artifact_id match + optional timestamp proximity bonus.
  CAUSAL        Artifact match AND event_type match required for full credit.
  TEMPORAL      Boolean match routed by temporal_category (knowledge_gap/
                point_in_time/stress_state/propagation). Ground truth field
                is had_knowledge, was_true, or knew_before per sub-category.
  GAP_DETECTION Boolean was_actioned + downstream artifact overlap.
  ROUTING       first_recipient exact match.
  PLAN          dept + theme match (theme uses substring matching for LLM prose).
  ESCALATION    escalation_actors set match, partial credit for overlap.
  KNOWLEDGE_GAP gap_areas set match, partial credit for overlap.
  ZD_RESOLUTION resolved boolean + duration_days exact match; escalated bonus.
  SF_RISK       incident_id match + at_risk_accounts set overlap.
  NPS_SCORE     nps_score exact + classification match; escalated_tickets bonus.
  INVOICE_SLA   breach_duration_days exact + sla_credit_per_org within 5%.

Partial credit via evidence_chain
----------------------------------
All question types award partial credit if the agent retrieved relevant
artifacts from evidence_chain even when the final answer is wrong.
This separates retrieval quality from reasoning quality, which is useful
for diagnosing whether failures come from the retriever or the reader.

Usage
-----
    from scorer import OrgForgeScorer, ScorerResult

    scorer = OrgForgeScorer()
    result = scorer.score(question, agent_answer)

    # Batch
    results = scorer.score_all(questions, agent_answers)
    report  = scorer.report(results)
