---

## [v1.2.5] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Global Voice Card System (`utils/persona_utils.py`, `src/normal_day.py`)**: Migrated individual persona logic to a centralized `get_voice_card` utility. This provides context-aware character sheets (e.g., `async`, `design`, `collision`) that inject tenure, expertise, mood, and "anti-patterns" into LLM backstories to prevent generic corporate drift.
- **Robust JSON Recovery (`requirements.txt`, `src/flow.py`, `src/normal_day.py`)**: Integrated `json-repair` across the simulation pipeline. This allows the engine to "salvage" malformed LLM responses in ticket generation and Slack conversations, significantly reducing "failed to parse" fallbacks.

### Changed

- **Persona History Filtering (`src/memory.py`)**: Enhanced `persona_history` to filter out "noisy" macro-events (like sprint planning summaries or standups). This ensures agents focus on personal agency and direct interactions when building their local context.
- **Incident Recurrence Logic (`src/causal_chain_handler.py`)**: Refined the `RecurrenceDetector` to prioritize the earliest incident in a chain (anti-daisy-chaining). This ensures new incidents link back to the original root cause rather than just the most recent duplicate.
- **Streamlined codebase (`Across all files`)**: Conducted a major cleanup of legacy comments, "ASCII art" section dividers, and redundant docstrings to improve readability and reduce token overhead during development.

### Fixed

- **PR Causal Linking (`src/flow.py`)**: Fixed a bug where PR IDs were missing from the persistent ticket record. PRs are now immediately appended to the `CausalChainHandler` and saved to MongoDB upon creation.
- **Department Signal Noise (`src/day_planner.py`)**: Non-engineering departments (Sales, HR) now only receive "direct" relevance signals, preventing them from being overwhelmed by technical incident data that doesn't impact their planning.

---

## [v1.2.4] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Automated Ticket Resolution on PR Merge (`src/flow.py`)**: Enhanced the `review_pending` stage to automatically transition linked JIRA tickets to "Done" upon a successful PR merge. This includes updating the `updated_at` timestamp and persisting the state to both internal memory and local JSON storage.

### Changed

- **Priya Persona Refinement (`config/config.yaml`)**: Updated the Design persona to emphasize grounded, technical specificity over abstract or "purple" prose. Her verbosity is now explicitly defined as being rooted in design details (e.g., UI variants, emotional reads of icons) rather than metaphorical or poetic language.
- **Logging Clarity (`src/flow.py`)**: Cleaned up the resolution log output by removing unnecessary indentation, ensuring more consistent formatting in the terminal during simulation runs.

### Fixed

- **Redundant PR Metadata (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Removed a duplicate `linked_ticket` argument in the `create_pr` call within `NormalDayHandler` to align with the underlying Git utility signature and reduce redundant parameter passing.

---

## [v1.2.3] — 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Automated PR Stale Management (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Introduced `_try_force_merge_stale_pr` to identify and resolve engineering bottlenecks. PRs idling in review for more than 5 days without requested changes are now automatically merged by "GitHub Actions," transitioning the associated JIRA ticket to "Done."
- **Refactored Ticket Completion Logic (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Split monolithic ticket processing into `_complete_non_eng_ticket` and `_complete_eng_ticket`. This modular approach handles specialized artifacts (Confluence, Email, Slack) for non-engineering roles and PR lifecycle management for developers.
- **PR Tracking in Memory (`src/flow.py`)**: Added `upsert_pr` calls during the initial PR creation flow to ensure the internal memory state is immediately consistent with the simulated Git state.

### Changed

- **Code Cleanliness and Scoping (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Significant refactoring of the `NormalDayHandler` to reduce nesting. Improved logic for "force spawning" PRs on engineering tickets that have been in progress for 3+ days to prevent sprint stagnation.
- **Causal Chain Integration (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Enhanced tracking for incident-related tickets; any PRs or comments spawned during a ticket update are now automatically appended to the active incident's `causal_chain` for better forensic simulation.
- **Ticket Status Metadata (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Added `in_review_since` timestamps to tickets when they transition to the review phase, allowing for more granular tracking of review cycle times.

### Fixed

- **Redundant Vector Search Logic (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Removed deprecated Tier 1 context comments and unused local variables (`linked_prs`) from the main loop to favor the new structured context retrieval system.
- **Non-Engineering Event Tagging (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Corrected the `SimEvent` logging to accurately tag events as `non_eng` or `engineering` based on the ticket's department type, ensuring cleaner data for downstream sentiment analysis.

---

## [v1.2.2] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Serialization Handling**: Added {"\_id": 0} to MongoDB queries to prevent ObjectId serialization errors in LLM artifacts and API responses.

---

## [v1.2.1] — 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Background Embedding Queue (`src/embed_worker.py`, `src/flow.py`, `src/memory.py`)**: Introduced `EmbedWorker` to decouple LLM artifact generation from vector embeddings. Embeddings are now processed in a background thread queue, preventing inference blocking. Added `drain()` synchronization before vector searches and end-of-day checkpoints to ensure causal consistency.
- **Parallel Genesis Execution (`src/flow.py`, `src/confluence_writer.py`)**: Genesis initialization is now parallelized using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Persona embeddings, email source generation, and independent Confluence page batches (e.g., ENG vs. MKT) run concurrently.
- **Parallel Day Planning (`src/day_planner.py`)**: Department-level daily plans (excluding Engineering) are now generated concurrently to speed up the daily simulation loop. Added a fallback mechanism to return an empty plan if a department's planning thread fails.

### Changed

- **Simulation Engine Architecture (`src/flow.py`)**: Replaced `crewai.flow.flow.Flow` dependency with a custom `OrgForgeSimulation` class. The main execution loop now runs via standard methods (`genesis_phase`, `daily_cycle`) rather than CrewAI's `@start` and `@listen` decorators.
- **Default Quality Preset (`config/config.yaml`, `README.md`, `.env.example`)**: Promoted `local_gpu` to the default simulation preset and completely removed the `local_cpu` profile.
- **Thread-Safe Artifact Registry (`src/artifact_registry.py`)**: Added `threading.Lock()` to `next_id()`, `register_confluence()`, `next_jira_id()`, and `register_jira()` to prevent ID collision race conditions during the newly parallelized genesis and sprint generation phases.
- **Checkpoint Serialization (`src/memory.py`, `src/flow.py`)**: Checkpoint saves and restores now explicitly include `active_incidents` (with causal chains), `sprint`, `resolved_incidents`, and `morale_history`.
- **Database Reset Logic (`src/memory.py`)**: `reset()` now drops the entire MongoDB database directly rather than enumerating and dropping individual collections, ensuring no orphaned collections remain.

### Fixed

- **Infinite Loop in Clock (`src/sim_clock.py`)**: Added a 7-day `max_skip` limit to the `skip_to_next_business_day` function to prevent potential infinite loops if a valid business day cannot be found.
- **Ticket Assigner Vector Retrieval (`src/ticket_assigner.py`)**: Fixed `_engineer_vectors` initialization to correctly fetch pre-computed persona embeddings directly from MongoDB instead of attempting to rebuild them on the fly.
- **Insider Threat Defaults (`config/config.yaml`)**: Set insider threat `enabled` flag to `false` by default to streamline base simulation runs.

---

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Probabilistic Incident Triggering (`src/flow.py`, `config/config.yaml`)**: Replaced keyword-matching on the daily theme with a probability-based model driven by `incident_base_prob` and system health. Incidents now fire after normal day work completes, placing them naturally mid-day in the artifact timeline. Configurable via `incident_base_prob` (default 0.15) and `incident_cooldown_days` (default 3) in `config.yaml`.
- **Root Cause Generation Decoupled from Engineer (`src/flow.py`)**: Added `_generate_root_cause()` which derives incident root cause from tech stack, recent context, and sprint theme before any engineer is selected. Recent incidents (last 10 days) are injected as exclusions to prevent repeated root causes.
- **Skill-Based On-Call Routing (`src/flow.py`)**: On-call engineer is now selected via `find_expert_by_skill()` against the generated root cause rather than always resolving to the department lead. Both `Engineering_Backend` and `Engineering_Mobile` are eligible, routing mobile incidents to mobile engineers naturally.
- **`last_incident_day` State Field (`src/flow.py`)**: Added to `State` to track cooldown between incident firings.

### Changed

- **`_select_domain_expert` Dept Scope Parameter (`src/flow.py`)**: Now accepts an optional `search_depts` set, defaulting to both engineering departments. Replaced manual embedding and cosine similarity with `find_expert_by_skill()`, removing the dependency on `_ticket_assigner._engineer_vectors`.
- **Incident Trigger Keywords Removed (`config/config.yaml`)**: `incident_triggers` config block removed entirely.
- **All Departments Run Regardless of Incidents (`src/flow.py`)**: Normal day handler, email ingestor, threat injector, and social engineering runs are no longer gated behind an `else` branch. All activity proceeds daily; the incident fires after.
- **`RoutingScorer` Simplified (`eval/scorer.py`)**: `was_escalated` removed from primary scoring. Correct `first_recipient` now gives full credit, matching the question text which never asks about escalation status.

### Fixed

- **`StateWithId` Missing `last_incident_day`**: Field added to base `State` model, resolving `AttributeError` in integration tests.

---

## [v1.1.3] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Structured PR Review Verdicts (`src/normal_day.py`)**: PR review agents now emit a structured JSON response containing both a review comment and an explicit `verdict` (`approved` or `changes_requested`), with graceful fallback if the LLM returns malformed output.
- **Automated PR Merge & Ticket Resolution (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Approved PRs are now automatically merged via `git.merge_pr()` and their linked Jira tickets transitioned to `Done`. PRs with changes requested revert the linked ticket to `In Progress` and reset the force-spawn timer.

### Changed

- **Eval Question Volume (`eval/eval_harness.py`)**: Raised sampling caps for retrieval, causal, and temporal question generators from 8–12 to 50, enabling meaningful eval coverage on larger simulation runs. Removed `_plan_questions()` from the generation pipeline.
- **BM25 & Cohere Corpus Field Fallback (`eval/eval_e2e.py`)**: Retrievers now fall back to the `content` field when `body` is absent, fixing indexing gaps for artifacts that use alternate field naming.
- **HF Dataset ID Externalized (`eval/eval_e2e.py`)**: Hardcoded dataset ID replaced with `HF_DATASET_ID` environment variable, defaulting to a placeholder.
- **Reply Thread Trigger (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Review reply threads now fire only on `changes_requested` verdicts rather than on any review containing a `?`, better mirroring real GitHub behavior.
- **`slack` → `slack_thread` Artifact Type (`eval/eval_e2e.py`)**: Updated the LLM judge prompt to use `slack_thread` as the canonical artifact type label.

### Removed

- **`eval/diag.py`**: Deleted one-time `backfill_escalation_artifacts` migration script, no longer needed.
- **Leaderboard outputs from version control (`.gitignore`)**: `leaderboard.csv` and `leaderboard.json` added to `.gitignore`.

---

## [v1.1.2] — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Host Data Hoarding Behavior (`src/insider_threat.py`)**: New `host_data_hoarding` threat behavior simulating a 3-phase, multi-day data staging trail (bulk file copy → compression → transfer). Available to `disgruntled` and `malicious` threat classes; requires cross-phase correlation for detection.
- **IDP Log Simulation (`src/insider_threat.py`, `INSIDERTHREAT.md`)**: New `idp_logs` config flag (default: `true`) emitting realistic daily SSO authentication records for all employees, with anomalous IDP events (off-hours, new device, ghost logins) layered on top for threat subjects.
- **Multi-Format Telemetry Output (`src/insider_threat.py`)**: New `log_format` config option supporting `jsonl` (default), `cef` (ArcSight/Splunk), `ecs` (Elastic SIEM), `leef` (IBM QRadar), and `all` for parallel output. Ground truth is always written as JSONL regardless of setting.
- **Recurrence-Aware PR Reviews (`src/normal_day.py`)**: PR review agents now receive a `recurrence_hint` when the linked ticket is a repeat of a prior bug, surfacing the ancestor ticket ID, recurrence gap, and prior root cause to inform more contextually grounded review comments.
- **Rich Ticket Context for Prompts (`src/context.py`)**: `context_for_ticket` now surfaces blocker events and prior `async_question`/`design_discussion` entries attached to a ticket, helping agents avoid rehashing settled decisions.

### Changed

- **Person-Scoped RAG Context (`src/normal_day.py`)**: Switched 1-on-1 meeting and mentoring session context retrieval from `context_for_prompt` (semantic search) to `context_for_person` (person-scoped lookup) for more relevant, targeted memory recall.
- **Telemetry Surface References (`INSIDERTHREAT.md`)**: Updated behavior documentation to reference `access_log.*` instead of `access_log.jsonl` to reflect multi-format output support across `excessive_repo_cloning`, `cross_dept_snooping`, and `data_exfil_email`.
- **Threat Class Profiles (`INSIDERTHREAT.md`)**: Updated detection difficulty descriptions for `disgruntled` (now requires IDP correlation) and `malicious` (now flags host hoarding and IDP anomalies as additional detection surfaces).
- **Documentation Formatting (`INSIDERTHREAT.md`)**: Aligned config and subject field reference tables, added `log_format` and `idp_logs` entries, and added new IDP log and industry-standard log format sections to the table of contents.

---

## [v1.1.1] — 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **String Truncation Limits (`src/`, `eval/`)**: Standardized and expanded summary truncation limits from 40–60 characters to **80 characters** across JIRA titles, Slack interactions, incident root causes, and PR titles to prevent critical context loss in logs and RAG retrieval.
- **RAG Embedding Logic (`src/memory.py`)**: Enhanced `OllamaEmbedder` to support **asymmetric retrieval**. The system now prepends specific instruction prefixes for `search_query` and `search_document` to improve embedding quality for models like Stella and MXBAI.
- **Causal Threading Fixes (`eval/eval_harness.py`)**: Refined `_design_doc_threads` to ensure design documents are only included in evaluation chains if they possess a valid `causal_chain` fact, preventing broken threads in the evaluation harness.
- **Codebase Formatting**: Applied consistent linting and multi-line dictionary wrapping across `eval/eval_harness.py` and `src/insider_threat.py` to match project style guidelines.

### Added

- **LLM-Driven Sentiment Drift (`src/insider_threat.py`)**: Replaced static text templating with a **CrewAI-powered rewriting task**. Disgruntled or malicious actors now use a `worker_llm` to authentically rewrite Slack messages, with negativity intensity scaling based on the days since the threat "onset."
- **Enhanced Vector Search Filtering (`src/memory.py`)**:
  - Added `type_exclude` support to `recall()`, allowing the RAG pipeline to explicitly ignore specific artifact types (e.g., hiding `persona_skill` from general queries).
  - Implemented a "causal floor" using the `since` parameter to allow bounded timestamp filtering ($gte and $lte) within MongoDB vector searches.
- **Comprehensive Memory Testing (`tests/test_memory.py`)**: Introduced a massive expansion of the test suite (20+ new tests) covering:
  - Ollama instruction prefix validation.
  - Mutually exclusive filter guards in `recall()`.
  - Upsert logic for artifacts to prevent vector index duplication.
  - Event-type skip lists to reduce embedding noise for high-volume, low-signal events like standard Slack messages.

---

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **Non-Engineering Planner Logic (`src/day_planner.py`)**: Refined department-specific task generation for Design, Sales, HR, and QA. Non-engineering teams are now explicitly barred from code-centric activities (PR reviews, ticket progress) and steered toward department-appropriate tasks like sales playbooks, onboarding guides, and UX documentation.
- **Causal Chain Expansion (`src/confluence_writer.py`)**: Postmortem documents are now programmatically appended to the causal chain of their parent incident. Design documents now initialize causal chains that include all JIRA tickets spawned during the architectural planning phase.
- **Expertise Granularity (`config/config.yaml`)**: Updated lead personas (Jax, Alex) with specific skill arrays (e.g., "database reliability", "Apple platform engineering") to replace broad category tags, improving the accuracy of the `_select_domain_expert` routing logic.
- **Default Orchestration Settings (`src/agent_factory.py`, `config/config.yaml`)**: Set agent `verbose` mode to `False` by default to reduce log noise. Shifted default AWS operations to `us-east-2` and extended the default simulation ceiling to 30 days.
- **Codebase Formatting**: Applied consistent linting and line-wrapping across `eval/` and `src/` modules to improve readability and maintainability.

### Added

- **Insider Threat Simulation Framework (`src/insider_threat.py`)**: Introduced a modular system to inject anomalous behaviors into the simulation. This includes:
- **Threat Classes**: Support for "negligent" (accidental credential leaks), "disgruntled" (sentiment drift and snooping), and "malicious" (data exfiltration) actors.
- **Multi-Channel Injection**: Ability to inject malicious content into Slack threads, PR descriptions, and outbound emails.
- **Security Telemetry**: New `dlp_alert` and `secret_detected` event types, with automated generation of `access_log.jsonl` and `_ground_truth.jsonl` for SOC analyst agent training.

- **Morgan Persona (`config/config.yaml`)**: Added a "Systems Thinker" DevOps persona to the Engineering_Backend team, including specific typing quirks (tool-forward, precise) and infrastructure-heavy expertise.
- **Design Doc Evaluation (`eval/eval_harness.py`)**: Added `_design_doc_threads` to the evaluation suite, enabling RAG benchmarking against complex architectural causal chains and downstream ticket spawning.
- **Day-Based Memory Filtering (`src/memory.py`)**: Added `day` to the vector store's metadata filters, allowing agents to perform time-bound document retrieval more efficiently.

---

## [v1.0.2] — 2026-03-16

### Changed

- **Multi-Artifact Corpus Rows (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: `_sim_event_to_row` now returns a list of rows instead of a single row, emitting one corpus entry per artifact type (JIRA, Confluence, email, Slack, PR) when an event references multiple artifact IDs. Previously, only the first matched artifact type was captured per event, silently dropping the rest.
- **Corpus Deduplication by Body Length (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: After row generation, duplicates sharing a `doc_id` are collapsed by keeping the row with the longest body, ensuring the richest available content wins.
- **Evidence Overlap Metric: Jaccard → Recall (`eval/scorer.py`)**: `_evidence_overlap` now computes recall (`hits / |ground_truth chain|`) instead of Jaccard similarity. Jaccard structurally capped scores for short evidence chains retrieved in a fixed top-K window, causing accuracy to read as 0 regardless of answer quality.
- **Actor-to-Department Inference (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: Corpus rows now populate `dept` by walking the event's actor list against an `_ACTOR_TO_DEPT` map built from `org_chart` config, falling back to `_dept_from_artifact_id` for Confluence IDs. Previously `dept` was sourced exclusively from `facts.dept` and was frequently blank.
- **CONF-UNKNOWN Resolution & Reclassification (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: During MongoDB enrichment, rows with `doc_id=CONF-UNKNOWN` are now resolved to real Confluence page IDs by matching body snippet or title against the `confluence_pages` collection. Rows that cannot be matched (social-interaction events mistakenly emitted a Confluence key) are reclassified as `slack` with a stable `SLACK-SOCIAL-*` ID.
- **JIRA Comments Folded into Parent Body (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: `jira_comment` artifacts are now fetched from MongoDB and appended to their parent JIRA ticket body during enrichment, consolidating discussion context into a single corpus document.
- **`POSTMORTEM` Question Routing (`eval/scorer.py`)**: Questions with a `question_id` prefixed `postmortem_` are re-routed to `PostmortemScorer` at dispatch time, overriding a stored `question_type=CAUSAL` label. `CausalScorer` also gains a fallback to `postmortem_confluence_id` when `artifact_id` is absent in the ground truth.
- **`results/` Added to Ignore Files (`.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`)**: The `results/` directory is now excluded from both version control and Docker build context.
- **Citation Block Added (`README.md`)**: A BibTeX citation entry for the accompanying arXiv preprint has been added to the README.

### Added

- **`PostmortemScorer` (`eval/scorer.py`)**: New scorer for `POSTMORTEM` question type. Awards full primary credit when the agent's `artifact_id` matches `postmortem_confluence_id` in ground truth; partial credit via evidence-chain recall.
- **`POSTMORTEM`, `STANDUP`, `CUSTOMER_ESC` Scorer Registrations (`eval/scorer.py`)**: Three question types documented in the README but absent from `_SCORERS` are now registered. `POSTMORTEM` routes to `PostmortemScorer`, `STANDUP` to `RetrievalScorer`, and `CUSTOMER_ESC` to `CausalScorer`.
- **Orphan Artifact Sweep (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: A new end-of-enrichment pass queries MongoDB `artifacts` for any Confluence, Slack thread, email, PR, or JIRA documents not yet present in the corpus and appends them, preventing artifacts that were never referenced by a `SimEvent` from being omitted entirely.
- **`_dept_from_artifact_id` Helper (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: New utility that derives a department name from a Confluence artifact ID prefix (e.g. `CONF-ENG-019 → Engineering`).

---

## [v1.0.1] — 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Eval Harness (`eval/eval_harness.py`)**: New post-simulation eval dataset generator for OrgForge. Produces structured evaluation datasets from completed simulation runs.
- **HuggingFace Export Pipeline (`eval/export_to_hf.py`)**: Normalises OrgForge simulation artifacts into a flat HuggingFace-ready corpus. Runs BM25 and dense-retrieval baselines, produces Parquet files, and writes a dataset card to `export/hf_dataset/`.
- **Eval Scorer (`eval/scorer.py`)**: Per-question-type scoring for the OrgForge eval dataset.

---

## [v1.0.0-preprint] — 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Reduced Department History Window (`day_planner.py`)**: The recent department history used in planner prompts is now capped at the last 2 days (down from 7). Older history added noise without meaningfully changing planning decisions; open incidents are already surfaced separately in the Active Incidents section.
- **Scoped Cross-Department Signals for Non-Engineering (`day_planner.py`)**: Non-engineering departments (Sales, Design, QA, etc.) now only receive `direct` relevance signals, capped at 2 (down from 4). Engineering retains the full ranked view of up to 4 signals. Engineering's daily plan summary shown to other departments is now condensed to one line per engineer rather than enumerating proposed events.
- **Condensed Planner Prompt Labels (`day_planner.py`)**: Section headers for department history, cross-department signals, and active incidents have been shortened to reduce prompt token usage.
- **Verbose Crew Logging Removed (`flow.py`)**: `verbose=True` has been dropped from `Crew` instantiation in the sprint theme and standup generation paths, reducing log noise.

### Added

- **MongoDB Index Coverage (`memory.py`)**: Added compound indexes on the `_events`, `_checkpoints`, and `_jira` collections covering common query patterns (type + day, type + timestamp, actors + timestamp, type + JIRA artifact ID, tags, and type + participants), improving query performance at scale.

### Fixed

- **Agent Factory Debug Logging (`agent_factory.py`)**: Removed a verbose per-agent `DEBUG` block that logged role, goal, and backstory on every agent creation, which was generating excessive output without operational value.

---

## [v0.7.3] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Outbound Email Replies (`external_email_ingest.py`)**: The simulation now generates outbound acknowledgment emails for both customer and vendor inbound emails. Sales leads send warm follow-up replies to customers (with escalation context for high-priority emails), while engineers send brief technical acknowledgments to vendors, optionally referencing the linked JIRA ticket.
- **Domain-Expert Incident Routing (`flow.py`)**: Introduced `_select_domain_expert()` which uses cosine similarity against engineer expertise embeddings to route incidents to the most relevant backend or mobile engineer, rather than always defaulting to the static `incident_commander` role.
- **Incident PR Review Stage (`flow.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Added a `review_pending` stage to the incident lifecycle. When a fix PR is ready, assigned reviewers now generate genuine review comments (with optional author replies for questions) before the incident is resolved. Review activity is appended to the incident's causal chain.
- **Recurrence Chain Traversal (`flow.py`)**: Incident objects now track `recurrence_chain_root` and `recurrence_chain_depth` by walking the full ancestry of recurring incidents, preventing shallow recurrence links (e.g. ORG-164 → ORG-161 instead of ORG-164 → ORG-140).
- **Standup Thread Embedding (`flow.py`)**: Standup Slack threads are now embedded as `slack_thread` artifacts in the memory store for retrieval in future prompts.
- **Event Vector Search (`memory.py`)**: Added `search_events()` to `Memory`, enabling vector search over the events collection with optional type and day filters.
- **`type_exclude` Filter for Recall (`memory.py`)**: `Memory.recall()` now accepts a `type_exclude` list as a mutually exclusive alternative to `type_filter`, allowing callers to exclude artifact types (e.g. `persona_skill`) from retrieval results.
- **Pre-Sim Employee Departure Logging (`flow.py`)**: Genesis now reads `knowledge_gaps` from config and logs historical `employee_departed` events at their correct negative day offsets, grounding the simulation in pre-existing org knowledge loss.
- **Company Description in Slack Tasks (`normal_day.py`)**: Async question and design discussion prompts now include the `COMPANY_DESCRIPTION` constant for richer, company-aware Slack generation.
- **JIRA Ticket Embedding on Progress (`normal_day.py`)**: When ticket progress is recorded, the full ticket document (title, description, root cause, comments) is now embedded as a `jira` artifact, making ticket content directly retrievable via vector search.
- **Incident PR Review Handler (`normal_day.py`)**: Added `_handle_pr_review_for_incident()` as a standalone method callable from the incident flow without requiring a planner agenda item.

### Changed

- **Embed Model Updated (`config/config.yaml`)**: Switched from `stella_en_1.5b_v5` (1536 dims) to `mxbai-embed-large` (1024 dims) for the Ollama embed provider.
- **Anti-Daisy-Chain Recurrence Matching (`causal_chain_handler.py`)**: `RecurrenceDetector` now collects all candidates above the confidence threshold and returns the **earliest** matching incident rather than the top-ranked one, preventing chains like A→B→C where A→C is the correct root link.
- **Corpus-Calibrated Text Score Normalisation (`causal_chain_handler.py`)**: Text search scores are now normalised against a fixed ceiling (`_TEXT_CEILING = 8.0`) and log-normalised within the result set, preventing rank-1 from artificially always scoring 1.0.
- **Focused Previous-Day Context (`memory.py`)**: `previous_day_context()` now uses an allowlist of high-signal event types (incidents, escalations, sprint planning, etc.) and leads with a structured health/morale header from the `day_summary` document, replacing the previous verbose enumeration of all events.
- **Prioritised Cross-Signal Formatting (`day_planner.py`)**: `_format_cross_signals()` now sorts signals by event priority (incidents first), caps output at 4 signals, and uses `source_dept` instead of enumerating every member's name.
- **Condensed Planner Prompt (`day_planner.py`)**: Agenda descriptions, focus notes, and the department theme are now length-capped (6 words / 10 words respectively), and the task is reduced from 4 steps to 3 to cut prompt token usage.
- **Causal Chain Persisted on PR Open (`flow.py`)**: When a PR is opened for an active incident, the updated causal chain is immediately persisted back to the ticket document in both MongoDB and on disk.
- **State Resume Key Fix (`flow.py`)**: Fixed a resume bug where `state_vars` was referenced incorrectly; the correct key is `state` (for `morale`, `health`, and `date`).
- **Email Sources Loaded on Resume (`flow.py`)**: `generate_sources()` is now called during resume so that pre-standup and business-hours email generation has source data available even when genesis is skipped.
- **Ollama HTTP Error Handling (`memory.py`)**: HTTP errors from Ollama embeddings are now caught separately with a detailed log message including the status code and error body, rather than being swallowed by the generic connection error handler.
- **Knowledge Gap Key Includes Trigger (`org_lifecycle.py`)**: The deduplication key for surfaced knowledge gaps now includes the triggering ticket ID, allowing the same domain gap to surface across multiple distinct incidents.
- **`vendor_email_routed` / `inbound_external_email` Removed from Planner Filter (`day_planner.py`)**: These event types are no longer included in the recent-events filter used by the orchestrator.
- **DeepSeek Drop-Params Removed (`flow.py`)**: The special-cased `drop_params` workaround for DeepSeek Bedrock models has been removed; `max_tokens: 8192` is now set uniformly.

### Fixed

- **Incorrect `artifact_ids` Keys (`external_email_ingest.py`, `org_lifecycle.py`)**: Standardised artifact ID keys to use `"email"` (instead of `"embed_id"`) and `"jira"` (instead of `"trigger"`) for consistency with the rest of the event schema.
- **`_find_pr` / `get_reviewable_prs_for` Leaking `_id` (`normal_day.py`, `memory.py`)**: MongoDB `_id` fields are now explicitly excluded from PR document queries.

---

## [v0.7.2] — 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Expertise-Aware Roster Injection (`day_planner.py`)**: The `DepartmentPlanner` now injects specific expertise tags from persona configs into the roster view, allowing the LLM to make more informed task assignments.
- **Persona Card Deduplication (`normal_day.py`)**: Introduced `_deduped_voice_cards` to merge identical persona/mood descriptions into a single header (e.g., "Raj / Miki / Taylor"). This significantly reduces token usage when multiple unconfigured "default" engineers are present in a thread.
- **Robust JSON Extraction (`confluence_writer.py`)**: Added a regex-like manual brace-matching wrapper around design doc parsing to ensure the system can extract valid JSON even if the LLM includes leading or trailing prose.

### Changed

- **Single-Shot Slack Simulation (`normal_day.py`)**: Refactored `async_question`, `design_discussion`, `collision_event`, and `watercooler_chat` to use a single LLM call returning a JSON array of turns. This replaces the sequential multi-agent "Crew" approach, providing the model with "full arc awareness" for better conversation flow while drastically reducing API overhead.
- **Strict Expertise Alignment (`day_planner.py`)**: Instructions now explicitly forbid assigning backend/infra topics to Design or UX personnel, requiring a direct map between agenda items and the engineer's `Expertise` tags.
- **Collaborator Validation (`day_planner.py`)**: Implemented strict filtering of collaborator lists against the `LIVE_ORG_CHART` to prevent the LLM from hallucinating or misspelling employee names.
- **Anti-Corporate Prompting (`normal_day.py`)**: Added "CRITICAL" negative constraints to Slack generation tasks to prevent generic corporate openers (e.g., "Hey team, let's discuss...") in favor of natural, direct workplace communication.
- **Improved Parsing Logs (`confluence_writer.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Enhanced error logging to capture and display the first 200 characters of failed JSON attempts for easier debugging of LLM output drift.

### Removed

- **Novel Event Proposing (`day_planner.py`)**: Removed the `proposed_events` schema and the "NOVEL EVENTS" instruction block from the `DepartmentPlanner` to streamline planning focus on core agenda items.

---

## [v0.7.1] — 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Persona Skill Embeddings (`memory.py`, `org_lifecycle.py`)**: Introduced `embed_persona_skills` and `find_expert_by_skill` to store employee expertise as searchable `persona_skill` artifacts at genesis and on hire, enabling semantic expert lookup via RAG.
- **Postmortem SimEvent Logging (`flow.py`, `confluence_writer.py`)**: Postmortem creation now emits a `postmortem_created` SimEvent with causal chain and timestamp, and `write_postmortem` returns the Confluence ID alongside its timestamp.
- **Dept Plan SimEvent (`day_planner.py`)**: `DepartmentPlanner` now logs a `dept_plan_created` SimEvent after each successful plan, capturing theme and per-engineer agendas.
- **Clock Injection (`day_planner.py`)**: `DepartmentPlanner` and `DayPlannerOrchestrator` now accept a `SimClock` instance for timestamped event logging.
- **Scheduled Hire Persona Fields (`config.yaml`)**: Taylor and Reese now include `social_role` and `typing_quirks` in their hire configs for richer character grounding.

### Changed

- **Cloud Preset Models (`config.yaml`)**: Switched planner and worker from `deepseek.v3.2` to `openai.gpt-oss-120b-1:0`; embedding provider changed from OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` (1024d) to Ollama `stella_en_1.5b_v5` (1536d).
- **Email Source Count (`external_email_ingest.py`)**: Default source count increased from 5 to 7; source generation prompt now includes explicit departmental liaison routing rules and stricter tech stack adherence constraints.
- **PR Review Causal Chain (`normal_day.py`)**: `pr_review` SimEvents now include a `causal_chain` fact when the PR is linked to an active incident or a prior ticket progress event.
- **`on_call` Field Added to `ActiveIncident` (`flow.py`)**: The on-call engineer is now stored directly on the incident model.
- **`get_event_log` DB Mode (`memory.py`)**: Accepts a `from_db` flag to query events from MongoDB sorted by timestamp, rather than always reading from the in-memory list.
- **Persona Embeddings at Genesis (`flow.py`)**: Persona skills are now embedded for all org members during the genesis phase before Confluence page generation.
- **`ARTIFACT_KEY_SLACK_THREAD` Renamed (`causal_chain_handler.py`)**: Constant corrected from `"digital-hq"` to `"slack_thread"`.
- **`knowledge_gap_detected` Removed from Known Event Types (`planner_models.py`)**: Cleaned up duplicate and stale entries in `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES`.

### Removed

- **`eval_harness.py`**: Removed the post-simulation eval dataset generator (causal thread builder and typed Q&A generator) from the source tree.

---

## [v0.7.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Inbound & Outbound Email Engine (`external_email_ingest.py`)**: Introduced a system for generating and routing realistic external communications.
- **Tech Vendor Alerts**: Automated alerts arriving pre-standup (e.g., AWS quota limits) are now semantically routed to the engineer whose expertise best matches the topic. If the topic overlaps with an active incident, the email is automatically appended to the incident's causal chain.
- **Customer Complaints**: Customer emails arriving during business hours are routed through a gatekeeper chain (Sales → Product). High-priority emails can automatically generate JIRA tickets.
- **HR Outbound**: The system now fires offer letters and onboarding prep emails 1-3 days before a scheduled new hire arrives, linking them to the hire's arrival event.

- **Eval Dataset Generator (`eval_harness.py`)**: Added a post-simulation evaluation tool that processes the `SimEvent` log to produce deterministic datasets for RAG testing.
- **Causal Thread Reconstruction**: Reconstructs explicit artifact graphs (e.g., email → Slack ping → JIRA ticket) to track the flow of information.
- **Automated Q&A Generation**: Uses the LLM to generate natural language questions (Retrieval, Causal, Temporal, Gap Detection, Routing) based on the deterministic ground-truth data from the simulation.

- **Dropped Email Simulation (`external_email_ingest.py`)**: Implemented a probabilistic drop rate (~15%) for customer emails, creating intentional gaps where an email is received but no downstream action (Slack/JIRA) occurs. These gaps are logged as `email_dropped` events for the eval harness to detect.

### Changed

- **Genesis Source Generation (`external_email_ingest.py`)**: External email sources (vendors, customers) are now generated via LLM during the genesis phase, grounded in the company's established tech stack, and persisted to MongoDB (`sim_config["inbound_email_sources"]`).
- **Causal Chain Integration (`flow.py`, `external_email_ingest.py`)**: Emails are now assigned `embed_id`s and rooted in a `CausalChainHandler`. This ensures every downstream artifact (Slack threads, JIRA tickets) is appended in order and snapshotted into `SimEvent` facts.

---

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- **CEO Persona & Role (`config.yaml`, `flow.py`)**: Added "John" as the CEO persona with a "Visionary Closer" style and "Pressure Multiplier" social role to drive high-level organizational themes.
- **Dynamic Tech Stack Generation (`confluence_writer.py`)**: The simulation now generates a canonical, industry-plausible tech stack at genesis, including legacy "warts" and technical debt, which is persisted to MongoDB for grounding all subsequent technical content.
- **Context-Aware Voice Cards (`normal_day.py`)**: Introduced a modular voice card system that adjusts persona metadata (tenure, expertise, mood, anti-patterns) based on the interaction type (e.g., 1:1 vs. design discussion) to improve LLM character consistency.
- **HyDE-Style Query Rewriting (`memory.py`)**: Implemented `recall_with_rewrite` to generate hypothetical passages before embedding, significantly improving RAG retrieval for ad-hoc documentation and design topics.
- **Automated Conversation Summarization (`normal_day.py`)**: The final turn of 1:1s and mentoring sessions now generates a JSON-based third-person summary of the discussion for future reference in the actor’s memory.
- **Social Graph Checkpointing (`flow.py`, `memory.py`)**: Daily state snapshots now include full serialization of the NetworkX social graph, allowing the simulation to resume with relationship weights and centrality metrics intact.

### Changed

- **Cloud Preset Default (`config.yaml`)**: The default `quality_preset` is now `cloud`, utilizing DeepSeek v3.2 on Bedrock for both planning and worker tasks.
- **Persona Depth Expansion (`config.yaml`)**: Significantly expanded all primary personas with detailed "anti-patterns" (behaviors the LLM must avoid) and nuanced typing quirks to prevent "corporate drift".
- **Multi-Agent Sequential Interactions (`normal_day.py`)**: Refactored Slack interactions (DMs, Async Q&A, Design) to use a dedicated Agent per participant in a sequential Crew, replacing the previous multi-turn single-agent approach.
- **Unified Role Resolution (`config_loader.py`)**: Role resolution (e.g., `ceo`, `scrum_master`) is now centralized in `config_loader.py` to ensure consistency across the planner, email generator, and flow engine.
- **Embedding Optimization (`config.yaml`)**: Default embedding dimensions reduced from 3072 to 1024 to align with updated Bedrock models.
- **Infrastructure Update (`docker-compose.yaml`)**: Upgraded local MongoDB Atlas image to version 8 and enabled `DO_NOT_TRACK`.

### Removed

- **Hardcoded Tone Modifiers (`flow.py`)**: Replaced static stress-to-tone mappings in `persona_backstory` with dynamic, graph-driven `stress_tone_hint` logic.
- **Redundant Stop Sequences (`flow.py`)**: Applied a patch to the CrewAI Bedrock provider to strip `stopSequences`, resolving compatibility issues with certain models.

---

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Persona-Driven Content Generation (`confluence_writer.py`, `flow.py`)**: Ad-hoc Confluence topics and sprint ticket titles are now generated at runtime via LLM calls grounded in each author's `expertise` tags, the current daily theme, and RAG context — eliminating the static `adhoc_confluence_topics` and `sprint_ticket_themes` lists from `config.yaml`. Changing `industry` now automatically shifts what gets documented and planned without any other configuration.
- **Active-Actor Authorship (`confluence_writer.py`)**: Ad-hoc pages are now authored by someone from `state.daily_active_actors`, ensuring every page is tied to a person provably working that day.
- **Expertise-Weighted Participant Routing (`normal_day.py`, `memory.py`)**: Added `_expertise_matched_participants()` and `Memory.find_confluence_experts()` to inject subject-matter experts into Slack threads and design discussions via vector similarity over existing Confluence pages, with social-graph proximity weighting as fallback. Applied to `_handle_async_question()` and `_handle_design_discussion()`, replacing previous random sampling.
- **Publish Ledger & Same-Day Dedup (`flow.py`, `confluence_writer.py`)**: `confluence_published_today` tracks root pages per day to prevent topic duplication and enforce causal ordering in expert injection.
- **Per-Actor Multi-Agent Conversations (`normal_day.py`)**: All Slack interaction types (1:1s, async questions, design discussions, mentoring, watercooler) now use a dedicated `Agent` per participant in a sequential `Crew`, with per-person voice cards derived from personas. Replaces the previous single-agent thread writer.
- **Causal Chain Tracking (`flow.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Incidents now carry a `CausalChainHandler` that accumulates artifact IDs (bot alerts, tickets, PRs, Confluence postmortems, Slack threads) as the incident progresses, providing full ground-truth traceability in SimEvents.
- **Recurrence Detection (`flow.py`)**: `RecurrenceDetector` identifies whether a new incident is a repeat of a prior one via vector similarity, annotating tickets and SimEvents with `recurrence_of` and `recurrence_gap_days`.
- **Sentiment-Driven Stress (`graph_dynamics.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: VADER sentiment scoring is applied to generated Slack content, nudging actor stress up or down based on message tone (capped at ±5 per artifact).
- **Simulation Checkpointing & Resume (`flow.py`, `memory.py`)**: Daily state snapshots (morale, health, stress, actor cursors) are saved to MongoDB after each day. On restart, the simulation picks up from the last checkpoint and skips genesis if artifacts already exist.
- **Dedicated MongoDB Collections (`memory.py`)**: Jira tickets, PRs, Slack messages, and checkpoints are now stored in dedicated collections (`jira_tickets`, `pull_requests`, `slack_messages`, `checkpoints`) with appropriate indexes, replacing in-memory state lists on `State`.
- **Token Usage Tracking (`memory.py`)**: Optional `DEBUG_TOKEN_TRACKING` mode logs all LLM and embed calls to a `token_usage` collection with per-caller aggregation.
- **Parallelized Sprint Planning (`flow.py`)**: Ticket generation is now done per-department in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`, with an LLM-negotiated sprint theme agreed between product and engineering leads before ticket creation begins.
- **LLM-Persona Org Theme & Dept Planning (`day_planner.py`)**: The CEO agent now has a persona-grounded backstory with stress level; department planners similarly use the lead's persona. Active incident context is injected into planning prompts with a narrative constraint preventing "Day 1 startup" framing.
- **Persona `interests` Field (`config.yaml`)**: All personas now have an `interests` list used to generate contextually grounded watercooler chat topics.

### Changed

- **State Artifact Lists Removed (`flow.py`)**: `confluence_pages`, `jira_tickets`, `slack_threads`, and `pr_registry` removed from `State`; counts and snapshots now query MongoDB directly.
- **Slack Persistence Unified (`memory.py`, `normal_day.py`, `flow.py`)**: All Slack writes go through `Memory.log_slack_messages()`, which handles disk export, MongoDB upsert, and thread ID generation in one call. `_save_slack()` now returns `(path, thread_id)`.
- **Ticket & PR Persistence Unified**: All ticket and PR mutations go through `Memory.upsert_ticket()` / `Memory.upsert_pr()` instead of mutating in-memory lists.
- **`ConfluenceWriter._finalise_page()` author signature**: `authors: List[str]` replaced by `author: str` throughout; single primary author is used for metadata, embedding, and the `author_expertise` upsert.
- **Embedding Improvements (`memory.py`, `artifact_registry.py`)**: Switched Bedrock embedder from Titan G1 to Cohere Embed v4 (1024-dim dotProduct with scalar quantization). Chunk size increased from 3K to 12K chars. Event types backed by other artifacts skip embedding to avoid duplication.
- **Sprint & Retro Cadence (`flow.py`)**: Sprint planning and retro days are now driven by a configurable `sprint_length_days` rather than hardcoded weekday checks.
- **`recall()` temporal filtering (`memory.py`)**: `as_of_time` and new `since` parameters now enforce causal floor/ceiling directly inside the MongoDB `$vectorSearch` pre-filter; accepts both `datetime` objects and ISO strings via `_to_iso()`.
- **Cloud preset updated (`config.yaml`)**: Default cloud planner upgraded to `claude-sonnet-4-6`; Bedrock worker also upgraded; embedder switched to local Stella 1.5B.
- **`config.yaml` persona stress levels reduced**: Marcus and Sarah's baseline stress lowered from 70–85 to 50–55.

### Removed

- **`adhoc_confluence_topics` and `sprint_ticket_themes` (`config.yaml`)**: Both static lists deleted; content is now generated at runtime.
- **`state.jira_tickets`, `state.confluence_pages`, `state.slack_threads`, `state.pr_registry`**: Removed from `State`; all reads and writes go through MongoDB.
- **`_legacy_slack_chatter()` (`normal_day.py`)**: Fallback single-agent Slack generation removed; the planner is now always required.
- **Hardcoded `CONF-` prefix in `id_prefix` config**: Stripped from `genesis_docs` configuration.

---

## [v0.4.1] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **Test Suite Mocking (`tests/test_flow.py`, `tests/test_normal_day.py`)**: Added `@patch("confluence_writer.Crew")` to `test_postmortem_artifact_timestamp_within_actor_work_block` to ensure the delegated writer is properly mocked. Fixed a `StopIteration` error in the postmortem test by asserting against the unified `confluence_created` event type containing a `postmortem` tag instead of the deprecated `postmortem_created` event. Mocked `ConfluenceWriter.write_design_doc` with a side effect in `test_design_discussion_confluence_stub_created_sometimes` to emit the expected simulation event during assertions.
- **Fixture Initialization (`tests/test_lifecycle.py`)**: Appended `_registry = MagicMock()` and `_confluence = MagicMock()` to the `mock_flow` fixture to prevent `AttributeError` crashes during test setup.

### Changed

- **Unified Confluence Generation (`flow.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Fully delegated the creation of genesis documents, postmortems, ad-hoc pages, and design doc stubs to the centralized `ConfluenceWriter`. Instantiated `ArtifactRegistry` and `ConfluenceWriter` in the `Flow` constructor and injected them into the `NormalDayHandler`.
- **Deterministic ID Allocation (`flow.py`, `config.yaml`)**: Updated `next_jira_id`, `_handle_sprint_planning`, and `_handle_incident` to pull JIRA IDs directly from the `ArtifactRegistry`. Refactored the `genesis_docs` prompts in `config.yaml` to generate single pages with explicit IDs rather than relying on brittle `---PAGE BREAK---` splitting. Stripped the hardcoded `CONF-` from the `id_prefix` configurations for engineering and marketing.
- **Structured Ticket Context (`normal_day.py`)**: Replaced the manual string formatting of JIRA ticket states in `_handle_jira_ticket_work` with `_registry.ticket_summary(ticket, self._state.day).for_prompt()`, ensuring the LLM receives complete, structured context. Added a graceful fallback if the registry isn't wired yet.
- **Documentation Cleanup (`ticket_assigner.py`)**: Removed outdated architectural notes referencing "Options B + C" from the module docstring.

---

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **Persona Type Safety (`flow.py`)**: Added explicit type guards in `_generate_adhoc_confluence_page` to ensure the `author` variable is resolved to a `str` before being passed to `persona_backstory`, resolving a Pylance `reportArgumentType` error.
- **SimEvent Schema Integrity (`normal_day.py`)**: Updated `_handle_collision_event` to include the mandatory `artifact_ids` field, properly linking unplanned Slack interactions to their generated JSON paths in the event log.
- **Test Suite Mocking (`tests/test_flow.py`)**: Corrected `TypeError` in incident logic tests where `MagicMock` objects were compared to integers; stress lookups in `graph_dynamics` now return valid numeric values during simulation tests.

### Changed

- **Linguistic Persistence Architecture (`flow.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Refactored `NormalDayHandler` to accept a `persona_helper` dependency, enabling all synthetic artifacts (Jira, Slack, PRs) to pull from a unified, stress-reactive linguistic fingerprint.
- **Multi-Agent Standup Simulation (`flow.py`)**: Replaced the single-agent "Tech Lead" standup with a multi-agent loop; each attendee now generates a unique update based on their specific typing quirks, technical expertise, and live stress level.
- **"Messy" Org Coordination (`day_planner.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Enhanced the `OrgCoordinator` to trigger unplanned "collisions"—ranging from high-synergy mentorship to high-friction accountability checks—based on the current tension and morale of department leads.
- **Dynamic Persona Schema (`config.yaml`)**: Expanded persona definitions to include `typing_quirks` (e.g., lowercase-only, emoji-heavy), `social_role`, and `pet_peeves` to break the "cousin" effect and ensure diverse, human-like technical prose.
- **Character-Accurate Ad-hoc Documentation (`flow.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Integrated persona backstories into the ad-hoc Confluence generator, ensuring background documentation matches the specific voice and stress state of the authoring employee.

---

## [v0.3.9] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **Duplicate ticket work (`day_planner.py`)**: `_parse_plan()` now maintains a
  `claimed_tickets` set across all engineer plans in a single planning pass.
  Any `ticket_progress` agenda item referencing a ticket ID already claimed by
  another engineer is stripped before execution, preventing multiple agents from
  independently logging progress on the same ticket on the same day. Violations
  are logged as warnings.
- **`_validator` attribute error (`flow.py`)**: `daily_cycle` was referencing
  `self._day_planner.validator` instead of `self._day_planner._validator`,
  causing an `AttributeError` on day 11 when `patch_validator_for_lifecycle`
  was first invoked.

### Changed

- **Ticket dedup safety net (`plan_validator.py`, `normal_day.py`)**: Added a
  secondary `ticket_actors_today` guard on `state` that tracks which actors have
  executed `ticket_progress` against a given ticket ID within the current day.
  The validator checks this before approving `ProposedEvent` entries via
  `facts_hint["ticket_id"]`, and `_handle_ticket_progress` registers the actor
  on success. Resets to `{}` at the top of each `daily_cycle()`. Acts as a
  catch-all for paths that bypass `_parse_plan`.

---

## [v0.3.8] — 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Automated PR generation from ticket completion** (`normal_day.py`, `flow.py`): When an engineer's LLM output indicates `is_code_complete: true`, `_handle_ticket_progress` now automatically calls `GitSimulator.create_pr`, attaches the resulting PR ID to the ticket, and advances its status to "In Review". The ticket JSON on disk is updated atomically at the same timestamp.
- **LLM-authored PR descriptions** (`flow.py`): `GitSimulator` now accepts a `worker_llm` parameter and uses a CrewAI agent to write a contextual Markdown PR body ("What Changed" / "Why") using memory context, falling back to a plain auto-generated string on failure.
- **JIRA ticket spawning from design discussions** (`normal_day.py`): `_create_design_doc_stub` now receives the live Slack transcript and prompts the planner LLM for structured JSON containing both the Confluence markdown and 1–3 concrete follow-up `new_tickets`. Each ticket is saved to state, written to disk, and embedded in memory so the `DayPlanner` can schedule it the next day.
- **Blocker detection and memory logging** (`normal_day.py`): `_handle_ticket_progress` scans the LLM comment for blocker keywords and, when found, logs a `blocker_flagged` `SimEvent` with the relevant ticket and actor.

### Changed

- **`_handle_ticket_progress` now outputs structured JSON** (`normal_day.py`): The engineer agent is prompted to return `{"comment": "...", "is_code_complete": boolean}` rather than plain text, enabling downstream PR automation. Falls back gracefully on parse failure.
- **`DepartmentPlanner` prompt hardened** (`day_planner.py`): Added critical rules for role enforcement (non-engineering staff cannot perform engineering tasks), ticket allocation (only the explicit assignee progresses a ticket), and event deduplication (one initiator per `design_discussion` / `async_question`). The `activity_type` field is now constrained to an explicit enum.
- **`OrgCoordinator` collision prompt tightened** (`day_planner.py`): Replaced the loose "only if genuinely motivated" language with numbered rules enforcing strict role separation, real-name actor matching, and a conservative default of `{"collision": null}`. Department summaries now include member name lists to reduce hallucinated actors.
- **Cross-department channel routing unified** (`normal_day.py`): Both `_handle_async_question` and `_handle_design_discussion` now derive the target channel from the full participant set — routing to `#digital-hq` whenever participants span multiple departments, rather than always defaulting to the initiator's department channel.
- **`GitSimulator` reviewer lookup made case-insensitive** (`flow.py`): Department membership check now uses `.lower()` string matching and `.get()` with a default weight, preventing `KeyError` crashes when node attributes are missing.

### Fixed

- Incident-flow PR creation now links the new PR ID back to the originating JIRA ticket and persists the updated ticket JSON to disk (`flow.py`).
- PR review comments are now written back to the PR's JSON file on disk before the bot message is emitted (`normal_day.py`).

---

## [v0.3.7] — 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Watercooler distraction system** (`normal_day.py`): Employees now have a
  configurable probability (`simulation.watercooler_prob`, default `0.15`) of
  being pulled into an off-topic Slack conversation during their workday. The
  distraction is gated once per employee per day, targets a randomly selected
  agenda item rather than always the first, and pulls in 1–2 colleagues weighted
  by social graph edge strength. A context-switch penalty (`0.16–0.25h`) is
  applied both to the agenda item's estimated hours and to the SimClock cursor,
  so the time cost is reflected in downstream scheduling.
- **`test_normal_day.py`**: First test suite for `NormalDayHandler`. Covers
  dispatch routing, ticket progress, 1:1 handling, async questions, design
  discussions, mentoring, SimClock cursor advancement, distraction gate
  behaviour, graph dynamics integration, and utility functions (30 tests).

### Fixed

- Distraction index selection now uses `random.choice` over the full list of
  non-deferred agenda item indices rather than always targeting the first item.
- Context-switch penalty now calls `self._clock.advance_actor()` in addition to
  mutating `item.estimated_hrs`, ensuring SimClock reflects the lost time rather
  than only the plan model.

---

## [v0.3.6] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Resolved `UnboundLocalError` for `random` in `normal_day.py` — removed redundant
  `import random` statements inside `_handle_design_discussion`, `_handle_1on1`,
  `_handle_qa_question`, and `_handle_blocked_engineer`. Python's function-scoping
  rules caused the conditional inner imports to shadow the top-level import,
  leaving `random` unbound at call sites earlier in the same function body.
- Updated `config/config.yaml` cloud model references to use the `bedrock/` prefix
  so model selection routes correctly to AWS Bedrock at runtime.

---

## [v0.3.5] — 2026-03-05

### Added

- Tests for `sim_clock.py` — full coverage of all public methods including
  business-hours enforcement, weekend rollover, and clock monotonicity.
- Tests for `SimClock` integration across `flow.py` and `org_lifecycle.py` —
  verifies artifact timestamps fall within actor work blocks, ceremony timestamps
  land in scheduled windows, and departure/hire events carry valid ISO-8601 times.

### Fixed

- `_embed_and_count()` — added missing `timestamp` parameter forwarded to
  `Memory.embed_artifact()`. Artifacts were previously embedded without a
  timestamp, breaking temporal filtering in `context_for_prompt()`.
- `SimClock.schedule_meeting()` — fixed `ValueError: empty range in randrange`
  crash when `min_hour == max_hour` (e.g. departure events pinned to 09:xx).

---

## [v0.3.4] — 2026-03-05

### Added

- `sim_clock.py` — Actor-local simulation clock replacing all `random.randint`
  timestamp generation across `flow.py` and `normal_day.py`. Each employee now
  has an independent time cursor, guaranteeing no individual can have two
  overlapping artifacts and allowing genuine parallel activity across the org.

- `SimClock.advance_actor()` — Ambient work primitive. Advances a single actor's
  cursor by `estimated_hrs` and returns a randomly sampled artifact timestamp
  from within that work block. Used for ticket progress, Confluence pages, and
  deep work sessions where no causal ordering exists between actors.

- `SimClock.sync_and_tick()` — Causal work primitive. Synchronizes all
  participating actors to the latest cursor among them (the thread cannot start
  until the busiest person is free), then ticks forward by a random delta.
  Used for incident response chains, escalations, and PR review threads.

- `SimClock.tick_message()` — Per-message Slack cadence ticker. Wraps
  `sync_and_tick` with cadence hints: `"incident"` (1–4 min), `"normal"`
  (3–12 min), `"async"` (10–35 min). Replaces the flat random hour assignment
  in `_parse_slack_messages()` so messages within a thread are always
  chronologically ordered and realistically spaced.

- `SimClock.tick_system()` — Independent cursor for automated bot alerts
  (Datadog, PagerDuty, GitHub Actions). Advances separately from human actors
  so bot messages are never gated by an individual's availability.

- `SimClock.sync_to_system()` — Incident response helper. Pulls on-call and
  incident lead cursors forward to the system clock when a P1 fires, ensuring
  all human response artifacts are stamped after the triggering alert.

- `SimClock.at()` — Scheduled meeting pin. Stamps an artifact at the declared
  meeting time and advances all attendee cursors to the meeting end. Used for
  standup (09:30), sprint planning, and retrospectives.

- `SimClock.schedule_meeting()` — Randomized ceremony scheduler. Picks a
  random slot within a defined window (e.g. sprint planning 09:30–11:00,
  retro 14:00–16:00) and pins all attendees via `at()`.

- `SimClock.sync_and_advance()` — Multi-actor ambient work primitive. Syncs
  participants to the latest cursor then advances all by a shared duration.
  Used for collaborative work blocks like pair programming or design sessions.

### Fixed

- Timestamps across Slack threads, JIRA comments, Confluence pages, bot alerts,
  and external contact summaries were previously generated with independent
  `random.randint(hour, ...)` calls, producing out-of-order and causally
  inconsistent artifact timelines. All timestamp generation now routes through
  `SimClock`, restoring correct forensic ordering throughout the corpus.

---

## [v0.3.3] — 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Change embedding endpoint to call `/embed` instead of `/embeddings` and
  update the handling of the response.
- Convert `event_counts` to a plain dict in flow.py

---

## [v0.3.2] — 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Use requirements.txt instead of hard-coded requirements in Dockerfile
- `docker-compose.py` should start the app from src/

---

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-03-04

### Changed

- remove doubled inc.days_active += 1 call
- remove duplicate \_day_planner.plan() call

---

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager`** — new module that owns all
  dynamic roster mutations. The engine controls every side-effect; LLMs only
  produce narrative prose after the fact. Three public entry points called from
  `flow.py` before planning runs each day:
  - `process_departures()` — fires scheduled departures and optional random
    attrition; executes three deterministic side-effects in strict order before
    removing the node (see below)
  - `process_hires()` — adds new engineer nodes at `edge_weight_floor` with
    cold-start edges, bootstraps a persona, and emits an `employee_hired` SimEvent
  - `scan_for_knowledge_gaps()` — scans any free text (incident root cause,
    Confluence body) against all departed employees' `knowledge_domains` and
    emits a `knowledge_gap_detected` SimEvent on first hit per domain; deduplicates
    across the full simulation run
  - `get_roster_context()` — compact string injected into `DepartmentPlanner`
    prompts so the LLM naturally proposes `warmup_1on1` and `onboarding_session`
    events for new hires and references recent departures by name
    _File: `org_lifecycle.py` (new)_

- **Departure side-effect 1 — Active incident handoff** — before the departing
  node is removed, every active incident whose linked JIRA ticket is assigned to
  that engineer triggers a Dijkstra escalation chain while the node is still
  present. Ownership transfers to the first non-departing person in the chain,
  falling back to the dept lead if no path exists. The JIRA `assignee` field is
  mutated deterministically; an `escalation_chain` SimEvent with
  `trigger: "forced_handoff_on_departure"` is emitted.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._handoff_active_incidents()`_

- **Departure side-effect 2 — JIRA ticket reassignment** — all non-Done tickets
  owned by the departing engineer are reassigned to the dept lead. Status logic:
  `"To Do"` tickets keep their status; `"In Progress"` tickets with no linked PR
  are reset to `"To Do"` so the new owner starts fresh; `"In Progress"` tickets
  with a linked PR retain their status so the existing PR review/merge flow closes
  them naturally. Tickets already handled by the incident handoff are not
  double-logged. Each reassignment emits a `ticket_progress` SimEvent with
  `reason: "departure_reassignment"`.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._reassign_jira_tickets()`_

- **Departure side-effect 3 — Centrality vacuum stress** — after the node is
  removed, betweenness centrality is recomputed on the smaller graph and diffed
  against the pre-departure snapshot. Nodes whose score increased have absorbed
  bridging load; each receives `stress_delta = Δc × multiplier` (default `40`,
  configurable via `centrality_vacuum_stress_multiplier`, hard-capped at 20 points
  per departure). This reflects the real phenomenon where a connector's departure
  leaves adjacent nodes as sole bridges across previously-separate clusters.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._apply_centrality_vacuum()`_

- **New hire cold-start edges** — hired engineers enter the graph with edges at
  `edge_weight_floor` to cross-dept nodes and `floor × 2` to same-dept peers.
  Both values sit below `warmup_threshold` (default `2.0`) so `DepartmentPlanner`
  will propose `warmup_1on1` and `onboarding_session` events organically until
  enough collaboration has occurred to warm the edges past the threshold.
  `OrgLifecycleManager.warm_up_edge()` is called from `flow.py` whenever one of
  those events fires.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._execute_hire()`_

- **`patch_validator_for_lifecycle()`** — call once per day after
  `process_departures()` / `process_hires()` to prune departed names from
  `PlanValidator._valid_actors` and add new hire names. Keeps the actor integrity
  check honest without rebuilding the validator from scratch each day.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py`_

- **`recompute_escalation_after_departure()`** — thin wrapper called from
  `flow.py._end_of_day()` that rebuilds the escalation chain from the dept's
  remaining first responder after the departed node has been removed. Logs the
  updated path as an `escalation_chain` SimEvent for ground-truth retrieval.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py`_

- **New `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES`** — `employee_departed`, `employee_hired`,
  `knowledge_gap_detected`, `onboarding_session`, `farewell_message`,
  `warmup_1on1` added to the validator vocabulary so the planner can propose
  them without triggering the novel event fallback path.
  _File: `planner_models.py`_

- **New `State` fields** — `departed_employees: Dict[str, Dict]` and
  `new_hires: Dict[str, Dict]` added to track dynamic roster changes across
  the simulation; both are populated by `OrgLifecycleManager` and included in
  `simulation_snapshot.json` at EOD.
  _File: `flow.py` — `State`_

- **`simulation_snapshot.json` lifecycle sections** — `departed_employees`,
  `new_hires`, and `knowledge_gap_events` arrays appended to the final snapshot
  so the full roster history is available alongside relationship and stress data.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._print_final_report()`_

- **`org_lifecycle` config block** — new top-level config section supports
  `scheduled_departures`, `scheduled_hires`, `enable_random_attrition`, and
  `random_attrition_daily_prob`. Random attrition is off by default; when
  enabled it fires at most one unscheduled departure per day, skipping leads.
  _File: `config.yaml`_

### Changed

- **`DepartmentPlanner` prompt** — accepts a `lifecycle_context` string injected
  between the cross-dept signals and known event types sections. When non-empty
  it surfaces recent departures (with reassigned tickets), recent hires (with
  warm edge count), and unresolved knowledge domains so the LLM plan reflects
  actual roster state rather than a static org chart.
  _File: `day_planner.py` — `DepartmentPlanner._PLAN_PROMPT`, `DepartmentPlanner.plan()`_

- **`DayPlannerOrchestrator`** — holds a `validator` reference so
  `patch_validator_for_lifecycle()` can update `_valid_actors` before each day's
  plan is generated, without rebuilding the validator on every call.
  _File: `day_planner.py` — `DayPlannerOrchestrator.__init__()`_

- **`flow.py` module-level org state** — `ORG_CHART` and `PERSONAS` are now
  copied into `LIVE_ORG_CHART` and `LIVE_PERSONAS` at startup. All roster-sensitive
  code paths reference the live copies; the frozen originals remain available for
  config introspection. `OrgLifecycleManager` mutates the live copies in place.
  _File: `flow.py`_

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Enriched `day_summary` SimEvent** — the ground-truth end-of-day record now
  carries structured fields that make it genuinely useful for RAG evaluation.
  Previously `active_actors` was always `[]`; all fields below are now populated
  deterministically by the engine, not inferred by an LLM.
  - `active_actors` — names of everyone who participated in at least one event
  - `dominant_event` — most frequently fired event type for the day
  - `event_type_counts` — full `{event_type: count}` frequency map
  - `departments_involved` — derived from active actors via org chart lookup
  - `open_incidents` — ticket IDs of incidents still unresolved at EOD
  - `stress_snapshot` — `{name: stress}` for active actors only
  - `health_trend` — `"critical"` / `"degraded"` / `"recovering"` / `"healthy"`
  - `morale_trend` — `"low"` / `"moderate"` / `"healthy"`

  Two new `State` fields support this: `daily_active_actors: List[str]` and
  `daily_event_type_counts: Dict[str, int]`, both reset at EOD. Two new helpers —
  `_record_daily_actor()` and `_record_daily_event()` — are sprinkled at every
  event-firing site in `flow.py`.
  _Files: `flow.py` — `State`, `Flow._end_of_day()`, and all event handlers_

- **`planner_models.py`** — pure dataclass layer, no LLM or engine dependencies.
  Defines the full planning type hierarchy used by `day_planner.py` and
  `normal_day.py`:
  - `AgendaItem` — a single planned activity for one engineer on one day
  - `EngineerDayPlan` — full-day agenda with stress level, capacity calculation,
    and `apply_incident_pressure()` to defer low-priority items when an incident fires
  - `DepartmentDayPlan` — dept-level plan: engineer agendas + proposed events +
    cross-dept signals that influenced planning
  - `OrgDayPlan` — assembled from all dept plans after `OrgCoordinator` runs;
    `all_events_by_priority()` returns a flat sorted list for the day loop executor
  - `ProposedEvent` — an LLM-proposed event pending validator approval
  - `ValidationResult` — outcome of a `PlanValidator` check
  - `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES` — the vocabulary set the validator enforces; novel proposals
    outside this set are logged rather than silently dropped
    _File: `planner_models.py` (new)_

- **`plan_validator.py`** — integrity boundary between LLM proposals and the
  execution engine. Checks every `ProposedEvent` against five rules before the
  engine executes it:
  1. **Actor integrity** — all named actors must exist in `org_chart` or
     `external_contacts`; invented names are rejected with a clear reason
  2. **Novel event triage** — unknown event types are approved if they carry a
     known `artifact_hint` (`slack`, `jira`, `confluence`, `email`), and logged
     as `novel_event_proposed` SimEvents for the community backlog regardless
  3. **State plausibility** — tonally inappropriate events are blocked (e.g. no
     `team_celebration` when `system_health < 40`)
  4. **Cooldown windows** — configurable per-event-type minimum days between firings
  5. **Morale gating** — `morale_intervention` only fires when morale is actually low
     _File: `plan_validator.py` (new)_

- **`day_planner.py`** — LLM-driven planning layer that replaces `_generate_theme()`
  in `flow.py`. Three classes:
  - `DepartmentPlanner` — one instance per department. Receives org theme, 7-day
    dept history, cross-dept signals, current roster with live stress levels, and
    open JIRA tickets. Produces a `DepartmentDayPlan` via structured JSON prompt
    with graceful fallback for unparseable LLM output.
  - `OrgCoordinator` — reads all dept plans and identifies one cross-dept collision
    event per day. Prompt is intentionally narrow — only genuinely motivated
    interactions qualify (e.g. Sales reacting to an Engineering incident).
  - `DayPlannerOrchestrator` — top-level entry point called from `flow.py`.
    Engineering plans first as the primary driver; other depts react to
    Engineering's plan before `OrgCoordinator` looks for collision points.
    Rejected and novel events each produce their own SimEvent types so nothing
    is silently discarded.
    _File: `day_planner.py` (new)_

- **`normal_day.py` — `NormalDayHandler`** — replaces `_handle_normal_day()` in
  `flow.py` entirely. Dispatches each engineer's non-deferred agenda items to typed
  handlers that produce specific artifacts:

  | `activity_type`     | Artifacts produced                                       |
  | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ticket_progress`   | JIRA comment + optional blocker Slack thread             |
  | `pr_review`         | GitHub bot message + optional author reply               |
  | `1on1`              | DM thread (3–5 messages)                                 |
  | `async_question`    | Slack thread (3–5 messages) in appropriate channel       |
  | `design_discussion` | Slack thread + 30% chance Confluence design doc stub     |
  | `mentoring`         | DM thread + double social graph edge boost               |
  | `deep_work`         | SimEvent only — intentionally produces no artifact       |
  | deferred (any)      | `agenda_item_deferred` SimEvent logging the interruption |

  Falls back to original random Slack chatter if `org_day_plan` is `None`,
  preserving compatibility with runs that predate the planning layer.
  _File: `normal_day.py` (new)_

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **`_generate_theme()` switched from `PLANNER_MODEL` to `WORKER_MODEL`**
  Theme generation requires only a single sentence output and does not benefit
  from the planner's capacity. Using the 1.5b worker model reduces per-day
  overhead significantly given `_generate_theme()` fires every simulated day.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._generate_theme()`_

### Added

- **Timeout parameter on `OllamaLLM`** — explicit `timeout` value added to
  `build_llm()` to prevent `litellm.Timeout` errors on slower hardware where
  CPU-bound generation can exceed the default 600s limit.
  _File: `flow.py` — `build_llm()`_

---

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **`TypeError: SimEvent.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '_id'`**
  MongoDB documents fetched via `.find()` in `recall_events()` include internal
  fields (`_id`, `embedding`) that are not defined on the `SimEvent` dataclass.
  These fields are now stripped before constructing `SimEvent` objects.
  _File: `memory.py` — `Memory.recall_events()`_

- **`NameError: name 'prop' is not defined` in `_print_final_report()`**
  The `prop` variable returned by `graph_dynamics.propagate_stress()` was scoped
  locally to `_end_of_day()` but referenced in `_print_final_report()`. It is now
  stored as `self._last_stress_prop` and accessed safely via `hasattr` guard to
  handle runs that exit before `_end_of_day()` is called.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._end_of_day()`, `Flow._print_final_report()`_

### Added

- **`Memory.reset(export_dir=None)`** — clears MongoDB `artifacts` and `events`
  collections, resets the in-memory `_event_log`, and optionally wipes the export
  directory. Re-attaches the `FileHandler` to a fresh `simulation.log` after the
  wipe so logging continues uninterrupted.
  _File: `memory.py`_

- **`--reset` CLI flag** — passing `--reset` when invoking `flow.py` triggers
  `Memory.reset()` with the configured `BASE` export directory before the
  simulation starts, ensuring MongoDB and `/export` always represent the same run.
  _File: `flow.py`_

---

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- Initial release of the OrgForge simulation engine
- MongoDB vector search memory layer (`memory.py`) with Ollama, OpenAI, and AWS
  Bedrock embedding providers
- CrewAI-based daily simulation loop with incident detection, sprint planning,
  standups, retrospectives, and postmortem generation (`flow.py`)
- NetworkX social graph with stress propagation and edge decay (`graph_dynamics.py`)
- Export to Confluence, JIRA, Slack, Git PR, and email artifact formats
- Multi-provider LLM support via `quality_preset` config (`local_cpu`, `local_gpu`,
  `cloud` / AWS Bedrock)
- Knowledge gap simulation for departed employees
