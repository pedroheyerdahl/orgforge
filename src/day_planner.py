"""
day_planner.py
==============
LLM-driven per-department planning layer for OrgForge.

Architecture:
  DepartmentPlanner  — one per dept, produces DepartmentDayPlan
  OrgCoordinator     — reads all dept plans, injects cross-dept collision events
  DayPlannerOrchestrator — top-level entry point called from flow.py daily_cycle

Engineering is the primary driver. Other departments react to Engineering's
plan before the OrgCoordinator looks for collision points.

Replace _generate_theme() in flow.py with:
    org_plan = self._day_planner.plan(self.state, self._mem, self.graph_dynamics)
    self.state.daily_theme = org_plan.org_theme
    self.state.org_day_plan = org_plan   # new State field — see note at bottom

    _PLAN_PROMPT = """
    You are the planning agent for the {dept} department at {company} which {company_description}.
    Today is Day {day} ({date}).

    ## ABSOLUTE RULES — apply these before writing a single agenda item

    1. TICKET OWNERSHIP IS LOCKED.
    - An engineer may only have ticket_progress items for tickets in their OWNED list below.
    - Do NOT assign owned tickets to anyone else.
    - Do NOT invent ticket IDs.
    - related_id MUST come from the acting engineer's OWNED list, or be null.

    2. CAPACITY LIMITS.
    - Stay within each engineer's CAPACITY hours listed below.
    - estimated_hrs across all agenda items must not exceed their available hours.

    3. COMPANY CONTEXT — {company} IS ESTABLISHED, NOT A STARTUP.
    - Day {day} is the first day we are observing them, NOT the founding day.
    - They have years of existing code, legacy systems, and established processes.
    - DO write about maintaining systems, paying down tech debt, iterating on
        existing features, and routine corporate work.

    4. NON-ENGINEERING TEAMS (applies if {dept} is not Engineering_Backend or Engineering_Mobile).
    - Do NOT propose pr_review or any code-related activities.
    - ticket_progress IS allowed for non-engineering teams — it means completing an
      action item (writing a doc, sending an email, running an analysis, aligning
      with another team). The completion artifact is NEVER a PR.
      When using ticket_progress, set related_id from the engineer's OWNED ticket list.
    - DO use these activity types for your team:
        * ticket_progress  — completing a non-code action item tied to an owned ticket.
                            completion produces a confluence_page, email, or slack thread.
        * deep_work        — focused individual work (analysis, writing, planning)
        * 1on1             — check-in with a team member
        * async_question   — pinging another department for info or a decision
        * design_discussion — collaborative session to align on approach
        * mentoring        — senior helping junior
        * confluence_page  — writing internal documentation, playbooks, runbooks,
                            or process guides relevant to your team's expertise.
                            Use this at least once per day per department.
    - Examples by department:
        * Design     → ticket_progress (UX spec), design_discussion, confluence_page (design system docs)
        * Sales      → ticket_progress (sales proposal), async_question (pinging PM), confluence_page (playbook)
        * HR_Ops     → ticket_progress (onboarding checklist), 1on1 (wellbeing check), confluence_page (PTO policy)
        * QA_Support → ticket_progress (test plan execution), design_discussion, confluence_page (QA runbook)

    5. NO EVENT REDUNDANCY (CRITICAL TO AVOID DUPLICATES).
    - NEVER put collaborative meetings (1on1, mentoring, design_discussion, async_question) in the individual agendas of BOTH participants.
    - Assign the meeting to the INITIATOR'S agenda ONLY. 
    - List the other participants in the `collaborator` array.

    6. EXPERTISE ALIGNMENT IS STRICT.
    - Every agenda item MUST map directly to the assigned engineer's specific `Expertise` tags listed in the roster below.

    ---
    ## YOUR TASK

    1. Write a department theme for today (max 10 words) that reflects what 
    YOUR {dept} team is specifically doing — NOT a restatement of the org 
    theme. The org theme is context, not your theme. A Sales team theme 
    should sound like sales work. An HR theme should sound like HR work.
    2. Provide a 1-sentence reasoning for the overall plan.
    3. For each team member, write a 1-3 item agenda (keep descriptions under 6 words).

    ## BEFORE YOU OUTPUT — verify each of these:
    [ ] No collaborative meeting appears in more than one engineer's agenda
    [ ] All related_ids are null or from that engineer's own owned ticket list
    [ ] No engineer's estimated_hrs total exceeds their listed capacity

    Only output the JSON after confirming all three.

    Reads all DepartmentDayPlans and injects collision events —
    the natural interactions between departments that neither planned explicitly.

    Keeps its prompt narrow: it only looks for ONE collision per day,

    """

    _COORD_PROMPT = """
    You are the Org Coordinator for {company} which {company_description} on Day {day}.
    Your job is to find ONE realistic cross-department interaction that neither
    department planned for — a natural collision caused by stress, competing
    priorities, or misaligned timing.

    ## ABSOLUTE RULES

    1.VALID ACTOR NAMES — ONLY these names may appear in "actors":
    {all_names}

    2. {company} IS AN ESTABLISHED COMPANY.
    - Do not treat Day {day} as a founding day or early-stage moment.
    - Collisions should reflect mature org dynamics: competing priorities,
        resource contention, communication gaps — not greenfield chaos.

    3. PRIORITIZE FRICTION WHEN STRESS IS HIGH.
    - If a department lead has stress > 60, their department is a likely
        collision source. Use the stress levels below to pick realistic actors.

    4. IF NO COLLISION IS WARRANTED, SAY SO.
    - If morale is healthy and no department themes conflict, return:
        "collision": null
    - Do not invent friction just to fill the field.

    5. TENSION LEVEL must be exactly one of: "high", "medium", "low"

    ---
    ## COLLISION ARCHETYPES (use these as inspiration, not a checklist)

    - "The Accountability Check": A stressed PM pings Engineering lead for an ETA.
    - "The Scope Creep": Sales asks an Engineer for a "quick favor" mid-incident.
    - "The Wellness Friction": HR tries to hold a meeting while Eng is firefighting.
    - "The Knowledge Gap": Someone realizes a departed employee owned a critical service.
